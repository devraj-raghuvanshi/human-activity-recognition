# Human Activity Recognition using Accelerometer Data

This project implements a machine learning pipeline for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using accelerometer data. The goal is to classify physical activities based on sensor readings from two 3-axial accelerometers worn by participants.

## Overview

The project focuses on building a subject-independent model that can generalize across different users. The dataset used in this project includes data from 22 participants, each wearing two 3-axial Axivity AX3 accelerometers placed on the thigh and lower back. The model aims to predict activities like walking, running, cycling, and more, based on accelerometer readings.
